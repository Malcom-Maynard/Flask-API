Written Evaluation 

1.
O to implement the roles and persimmon within in the database I would SQL roles at give permissions as needed 
O example: post owners would have its own role and have the ability to alter the post table
O example: for the editors and viewers, they will have the ability to only select the tables, giving them read only access 
O with this, no changes would have to happen in the starter code


2.
o the patch operation would need further code for authorization
o once  the author is authenticated the role and permissions of the user would have to check
